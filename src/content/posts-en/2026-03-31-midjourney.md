## What Is Midjourney?

Midjourney is an AI image generation tool developed by Midjourney, Inc. in San Francisco. You type a text description (called a "prompt"), and the AI generates high-quality images in seconds.

**Core strengths:**
- **Top-tier image quality**: Industry-leading for photorealism, concept art, and illustration
- **V7 model**: Released April 2025, major improvements in realism and creative efficiency
- **Omni-Reference**: Upload reference images to precisely control characters, objects, and styles
- **Personalization system**: Train a custom style code (sref) for a unique visual identity
- **Improved Chinese prompt support**: V7 significantly improved Chinese language understanding

**Best for**: Graphic designers, illustrators, content creators, game artists, brand marketers, AI art enthusiasts.

## Your First Image: Quick Start

### Steps on the Website

1. Log in to midjourney.com, click "Create" in the left sidebar
2. Type your prompt in the input box at the bottom
3. Hit send and wait ~30-60 seconds
4. The system generates 4 candidate images — select one to upscale (U) or create variations (V)

### Your First Prompt

Start simple:

```
a cute orange cat sitting on a wooden table, soft morning light, photorealistic, 8k
```

Or try Chinese (V7 supports it):

```
一只可爱的橘猫坐在木桌上，柔和的晨光，写实风格，高清
```

### Understanding the Results Interface

After generation, you'll see 4 images and these buttons:

- **U1-U4**: Upscale the corresponding image (higher resolution and detail)

## Midjourney V7: New Features Explained

V7 is Midjourney's most significant update to date, officially released April 3, 2025.

### Draft Mode

Draft Mode generates preview images at **10x the speed** of standard mode, using only 1/4 the GPU time.

**Use cases:**
- Quickly validate creative directions before committing to full quality
- Batch-generate concept sketches, then refine the best ones
- Save GPU time and boost creative throughput

**How to enable**: Add `--draft` to the end of your prompt, or enable Draft Mode in settings.

### Omni-Reference

Launched May 2025, Omni-Reference lets you upload reference images to precisely apply specific characters, objects, or style elements to new images.

**Core value:**
- **Character consistency**: Keep the same character looking consistent across different scenes — great for series content
- **Object reference**: Precisely incorporate specific products or props into generated images
- **Style transfer**: Extract the visual style from a reference image and apply it to new content

**How to use:**
1. Click the image upload button to the left of the input box
2. Upload your reference image
3. Type your prompt describing the target scene
4. Adjust reference weight with the `--ow` parameter (range 0-100)

### Enhanced Realism

V7 significantly surpasses V6.1 in:
- **Skin texture**: More natural pores and surface detail
- **Lighting**: More accurate shadows and reflections in complex lighting
- **Spatial depth**: Better depth of field and perspective
- **Hands**: The notorious AI hand distortion problem is largely resolved

### Cinematic Lighting Control

V7 introduces professional-grade lighting parameters:

```
portrait of a woman, cinematic lighting, golden hour, rim light, --v 7
```

## Prompt Writing Techniques

### Basic Prompt Structure

```
[Subject description] + [Style/art form] + [Lighting/mood] + [Composition/angle] + [Quality modifiers]
```

**Example:**
```
a young woman reading a book in a cozy cafe, watercolor illustration style, 
warm afternoon light, close-up shot, soft colors, detailed, artstation
```

### Key Techniques

**① Specific beats vague**

❌ Vague: `a beautiful landscape`
✅ Specific: `misty mountain valley at sunrise, pine forest, golden light rays, aerial view`

**② Specify an art style**

Common style keywords:
- Photorealistic: `photorealistic`, `hyperrealistic`, `8k photography`
- Illustration: `digital illustration`, `concept art`, `artstation`
- Oil painting: `oil painting`, `impressionist style`
- Anime: `anime style`, `Studio Ghibli`, `manga`
- Minimal: `minimalist`, `flat design`, `clean lines`

**③ Describe lighting and mood**

- `golden hour`
- `soft diffused light`
- `dramatic side lighting`
- `neon lights`
- `candlelight`

**④ Use negative prompts (--no)**

```
portrait of a man, professional headshot --no glasses, hat, background clutter
```

**⑤ Weight control**

Use double colons `::` to assign weights to different elements:
```
cat::2 sitting on table::1
```

## Key Parameters

### Most Used Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--v 7` | Use V7 model | `--v 7` |
| `--ar` | Aspect ratio | `--ar 16:9` / `--ar 9:16` / `--ar 1:1` |
| `--s` | Stylization (0-1000, default 100) | `--s 750` |
| `--c` | Chaos/variety (0-100, default 0) | `--c 50` |
| `--q` | Render quality (0.25/0.5/1) | `--q 1` |
| `--no` | Negative prompt | `--no text, watermark` |
| `--seed` | Fix random seed | `--seed 12345` |
| `--draft` | Draft mode (V7 only) | `--draft` |

### Aspect Ratio Guide

- **Social media cover**: `--ar 16:9`
- **Phone wallpaper / vertical poster**: `--ar 9:16`
- **Instagram square**: `--ar 1:1`
- **Book cover**: `--ar 2:3`
- **Cinematic widescreen**: `--ar 21:9`

### Stylize Parameter

`--s` controls how much creative freedom the AI takes beyond your prompt:

- `--s 0`: Strictly follows the prompt, minimal creativity
- `--s 100` (default): Balanced mode, works for most cases
- `--s 500`: Stronger stylization, more artistic feel
- `--s 1000`: Maximum creativity, AI goes wild — results may surprise you

**Tip**: Start with the default. Use low values (50-200) for photorealistic images, high values (500-750) for artistic illustrations.

## FAQ

**Does Midjourney have a free tier?**
As of 2026, Midjourney has removed the free trial. The minimum subscription is the Basic Plan at $10/month, which includes ~200 image generations. Try Basic first, then upgrade if you like it.

**Can I use generated images commercially?**
Paid subscribers (Basic and above) can use generated images commercially, subject to Midjourney's terms of service. Pro Plan and above users have full commercial licensing with no attribution required.

**Why aren't my prompts working well?**
Common causes: prompt is too vague ("a nice picture"), important descriptions are buried at the end (put key elements first), no style or quality modifiers. Follow the structure in the prompt section above and add style, lighting, and quality keywords.

**What's the difference between V7 and V6?**
V7 is the main model for 2026. Key upgrades: Draft Mode (4x faster previews), Omni-Reference (character/style/object reference), significantly improved realism and lighting control. Use V7 by default; add `--q 1` for maximum quality.

**How do I use Midjourney outside the US?**
Midjourney requires access to Discord or the website, which may need a VPN in some regions. Subscriptions accept international credit cards (Visa/Mastercard) or PayPal. Once images are generated, you can download them locally — you don't need a persistent connection.
