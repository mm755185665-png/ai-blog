## Introduction

In 2026, the hottest term in AI isn't "large language model" — it's **AI Agent**.

From the top GitHub project OpenClaw, to Amazon's Health AI agent, to Claude Code's parallel multi-agent programming — "chat tools" are evolving into "autonomous systems that get things done."

This tutorial walks you through building a real, runnable multi-step AI Agent from scratch using **Claude 4.6 API + Python**.

## Setup

```bash
# Python 3.10+
pip install anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-xxxxxxxx"
```

## Core Concept: What Is an Agentic Loop?

```
User input
  ↓
Claude thinks → Need a tool?
  ├── Yes → Call tool → Get result → Back to Claude → Keep thinking
  └── No  → Output final answer
```

This "think → call → feedback" cycle is the **Agentic Loop** — the core of what makes an Agent different from a regular chatbot.

## Approach 1: Tool Runner (Recommended)

```python
import anthropic
from anthropic import beta_tool

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# 1. Define a tool with a decorator
@beta_tool
def calculator(expression: str) -> str:
    """Safely evaluate a math expression.

    Args:
        expression: A math expression, e.g. "2 + 3 * 4"
    """
    try:
        result = eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}})
        return f"Result: {expression} = {result}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"

# 2. Tool Runner handles the loop automatically
runner = client.beta.messages.tool_runner(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=4096,
    tools=[calculator],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Calculate: (123 + 456) * 789"}],
)

# 3. Iterate over results
for message in runner:
    for block in message.content:
        if block.type == "text":
            print(block.text)
```

## Approach 2: Manual Agentic Loop (Understanding the Internals)

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

tools = [{
    "name": "search_web",
    "description": "Search the web for up-to-date information",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "query": {"type": "string", "description": "Search query"}
        },
        "required": ["query"]
    }
}]

messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What were the major AI developments in March 2026?"}]

while True:
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-opus-4-6",
        max_tokens=4096,
        tools=tools,
        messages=messages,
    )

    # Agent finished — exit loop
    if response.stop_reason == "end_turn":
        for block in response.content:
            if block.type == "text":
                print(block.text)
        break

    # Agent requested a tool
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.content})

    tool_results = []
    for block in response.content:
        if block.type == "tool_use":
            # Simulate tool execution
            result = f"Search results for '{block.input['query']}': Claude 4.6 released with 1M token context..."
            tool_results.append({
                "type": "tool_result",
                "tool_use_id": block.id,
                "content": result,
            })

    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": tool_results})
```

## Sample Output

```
> python agent.py
[Tool call] search_web("major AI developments March 2026")
[Tool result] Search results for 'major AI developments March 2026'...

Based on the search results, major AI developments in March 2026 include:

1. **Claude Opus 4.6 released** — 1M token context window...
2. **Gemini 3.1 Pro** — leads on 13 benchmarks...
3. **GPT-5.4** — native computer control...
```

## Next Steps

- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Claude Code's parallel multi-agent architecture
- **Persistent memory**: Memory Tool + file system
- **MCP integration**: Connect to databases, browsers, code execution environments
- **Streaming output**: Use `.stream()` for real-time typewriter effect

## Summary

| Approach | Best For | Code Volume |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Tool Runner | Quick prototypes, production | Less |
| Manual Loop | Learning internals, custom control flow | More |

The Agent era is here. Now is the best time to get started.
